# Small DOL batch — 2026-09-13

Main starts at `086a3a84fac9d928c9176df3624582fd28befd45`, **347/396**
Matching DOL owners. This is the next ten-owner batch, not ten new closures.
Current locally verified frontier: **348/396**, **1/10** batch owners.

## NewMore: closed by the real adjacent provider

`Runtime.PPCEABI.H/NewMore.cp` is now source-selected and exact: five functions,
276 instruction bytes, 22 effective physical relocations, strict/data 100%.
Its source was already correct under the retained GC/2.6 exception/RTTI flags
and `-str nopool`; no function or artificial padding was added.

The original split incorrectly assigned the following `ptmf.c` object's
`__ptmf_null` to NewMore. NewMore's 90 string bytes align to 96; the real
12-byte const PTMF null object plus four bytes of normal alignment explains
the original 112-byte combined range. Correct ownership is:

- NewMore `.rodata`: `0x80216678..0x802166D8`.
- PTMF `.rodata`: `0x802166D8..0x802166E8`; `__ptmf_null` size 12.

The exception vtable is now identified by its real C++ symbol. Five string
extents and the bad-alloc RTTI extent exclude ordinary linker alignment;
target bytes and addresses are unchanged. The existing kerent export thunk
still has exactly the same branch bytes. Its imported label is now
`__ptmf_null`. MWCC requires a function-kind declaration for that existing ASM
branch operand; the source explicitly documents that the real provider is
data, not a callable C function. This preserves an inherited compatibility
thunk; it does not introduce a new ASM matching implementation.

Independent proof also preserves the PTMF and kerent instruction bodies. The
real source-selected Ninja/MWLD link passes all **137** configured retail
checksums (DOL plus 136 RELs). DOL SHA-256 remains
`172ae27aa6fcc9074de286b07ae4ac9f9152175fa913fffc3f5b8365e139ffec`.

Compact proof: `build/dol-small-next-20260913/newmore-provider/live-proof.json`;
physical rows: the adjacent `live-physical.json`. Source hash:
`147061638875e6bed3ffe582a20ac7bed847ba653554909b6567f7fe05bfdf79`;
candidate object `6f115f477d0cbc50510796ebfa290ca5d7a8cf17ed8062386be2b20dfe0455b5`;
original target `3c3d6d861ac59a091b8f210d94cbf01fb0c5c4b5cf673eb99b1ef24a12203a2d`.

## Closed tooling gap

The existing `tools/pool_reloc_summary.py` now accepts:

```text
section-tail TARGET_OBJECT CANDIDATE_OBJECT --provider ADJACENT_SOURCE_OBJECT
```

It distinguishes an alignment-only tail from a byte-compatible real named
provider and recommends inspecting the split boundary. It binds the ELF
hashes, sizes, actual object symbol, alignment hypothesis and compared bytes.
Ambiguous providers, unsafe alignment, wrong bytes, missing sections and
relocations in compared data return UNKNOWN/ambiguous rather than an owner
claim. Zero-byte coincidence alone is explicitly not ownership proof. It
neither edits a split nor advances matching authority.

The live original NewMore replay identifies `90 + 6 + __ptmf_null(12) + 4`.
This automates the diagnosis of the known closure; it did not discover a
second gain. Twenty-one focused tests pass, including legacy CLI behavior,
malformed ELF diagnostics and separate tool-code/result hash checks.

## Continuing small-owner work

Fresh unchanged-source objects reproduced GenderFilter 3/4 exact (constructor
79%) and Undersampler 3/4 exact (initializer 99.6875%). Two Qwen read-only
support jobs ran concurrently with the NewMore work. Neither supplied a new
retained source gain. An isolated constructor-profile-helper reconstruction
regressed and is not retained; the actual source remains unchanged. The
existing delayed/direct quotient and helper/count controls remain measured
constraints, not reasons to freeze either owner. Do not repeat those cells.

Small-owner scheduling must consider the remaining source cause, not just
file size or a high percentage. Keep the full current machine slice and the
compact rejected source classes in future support packets; do not ask a fresh
model to rediscover a known neutral conversion or helper boundary.
